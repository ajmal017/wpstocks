20. Members of the Conspiracy have publicly stated that they operate the Mega Sites in compliance with the notice and takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), codified at Title 17, United States Code, Section 512, despite the fact that they are violating its provisions. Internet providers gain a safe harbor under the DMCA from civil copyright infringement suits in the United States if they meet certain criteria. The members of Mega Conspiracy do not meet these criteria3 because they are willfully infringing copyrights themselves on these systems; have actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing (or alternatively know facts or circumstances that would make infringing material apparent); receive a financial benefit directly attributable to copyright-infringing activity where the provider can control that activity; and have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright infringing material from servers they control.
21. Members of the Mega Conspiracy negotiated the use of an “Abuse Tool” with some major U.S. copyright holders to purportedly remove copyright-infringing material from Mega Conspiracy-controlled servers. The Abuse Tool allowed copyright holders to enter specific URL links to copyright infringing content of which they were aware, and they were told by the Conspiracy that the Mega Conspiracy’s systems would then remove, or disable access to, the material from computer servers the Conspiracy controls. The Mega Conspiracy’s Abuse Tool did not actually function as a DMCA compliance tool as the copyright owners were led to believe.
